# Static

### Dependencies:
* `pillow`
* `pygame`
* `numpy`
* `scipy`
* If you wish for the static generator to play music after a random time of static, add a file called `music.mp3` to the root directory

### Usage:
`python static2.py [playMusic]`  
Where `playMusic` is a boolean. If it is not supplied, it will default to True.
